description: A fast, native, feature-rich terminal emulator pushing modern features

# Welcome to Ghostty

Ghostty is a terminal emulator that differentiates itself by being **fast**, **feature-rich**, and **native**. While there are many excellent terminal emulators available, they all force you to choose between speed, features, or native UIs. Ghostty provides all three.

<Note>
Ghostty is competitive in all three categories and doesn't make you choose between them. It aims to be one of the best fully standards-compliant terminal emulators while remaining compatible with all existing shells and software.
</Note>

## Why Ghostty?

Ghostty was built to push the boundaries of what is possible with a terminal emulator by exposing modern, opt-in features that enable CLI tool developers to build more feature-rich, interactive applications.

## Key Features

### Performance That Scales

- **Metal on macOS**: Direct Metal rendering with full ligature support (the only terminal besides iTerm with Metal)
- **OpenGL on Linux**: Hardware-accelerated rendering with minimal overhead
- **Dedicated IO Thread**: Very little jitter under heavy IO load
- **Optimized Text Rendering**: 4x faster than iTerm and Kitty, 2x faster than Terminal.app for plain text

### Cross-Platform Native

Ghostty is truly cross-platform but doesn't compromise on native experiences:

- **macOS**: SwiftUI-based application with native menu bars, settings GUI, and Metal renderer
- **Linux**: GTK-based application with native windowing
- **Shared Core**: Large shared codebase written in Zig for consistency

<Info>
The macOS app is a native Swift application that uses `libghostty` through its C API. This architecture enables embedding Ghostty in any third-party project.
