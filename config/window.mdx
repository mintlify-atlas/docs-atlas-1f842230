## Window Size and Position

### Initial Window Size

```ini
# Set initial window size (in grid cells)
window-width = 120
window-height = 40
```

<Note>
Both `window-width` and `window-height` must be set to take effect. If only one is set, it's ignored.
</Note>

<Accordion title="Can I set window size in pixels?">
Not currently. Window size is specified in terminal grid cells. Pixel-based sizing may be added in the future.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What's the minimum window size?">
Windows smaller than 10 columns by 4 rows are not allowed.
</Accordion>

<Warning>
**Linux/GTK**: Window size doesn't properly account for window decorations. Grid dimensions won't exactly match when decorations are enabled. Disable decorations (`window-decoration = none`) for accurate sizing.
</Warning>

### Window Position

```ini
# Set window position (in pixels)
window-position-x = 100
window-position-y = 100
```

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="macOS">
    Position is relative to the **top-left corner** of the visible screen area (below the menu bar if visible).
    
    ✅ Supported
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Linux/GTK">
    ❌ Not supported
    
    GTK doesn't support setting window position (Wayland restriction). Only works on X11 for legacy compatibility.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
Both `window-position-x` and `window-position-y` must be set to take effect.
</Note>

### Maximize and Fullscreen

```ini
# Start maximized
maximize = true

# Start fullscreen
fullscreen = true
```

<Info>
These settings apply to **all new windows**, not just the first one.
</Info>

<Warning>
**macOS**: `fullscreen = true` doesn't work with `window-decoration = none` (native fullscreen requires decorations).
</Warning>

## Window Decorations

Control window chrome (titlebar, borders, etc.):

```ini
window-decoration = auto      # Auto-detect (default)
window-decoration = none      # No decorations
window-decoration = client    # Client-side decorations
window-decoration = server    # Server-side decorations

# Legacy boolean values
window-decoration = true      # Same as "auto"
window-decoration = false     # Same as "none"
```

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="macOS">
    Only `none` and `auto`/`true` are meaningful:
    - `none`: Removes titlebar and borders, disables tabs
    - `auto`/`true`: Standard macOS window
    
    Use `macos-titlebar-style = hidden` to hide titlebar while keeping borders.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Linux">
    - `auto`: Best native appearance for your desktop
    - `client`: Client-side decorations (GTK-drawn)
    - `server`: Server-side decorations (requires compositor support like KDE Plasma)
    - `none`: No decorations
    
    If `server` is requested but unsupported, falls back to `client`.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
Toggle decorations at runtime with the `toggle_window_decorations` keybind action.
</Note>

## Window Padding

### Horizontal and Vertical Padding

```ini
# Symmetric padding
window-padding-x = 4  # 4pt left and right
window-padding-y = 4  # 4pt top and bottom

# Asymmetric padding
window-padding-x = 2,4  # 2pt left, 4pt right
window-padding-y = 2,8  # 2pt top, 8pt bottom
```

<Warning>
Excessive padding will squish the grid. Pick reasonable values. Warnings appear in logs for unreasonable values.
</Warning>

<Info>
Padding changes at runtime only affect **new terminals** (windows, tabs, splits).
</Info>

### Padding Balance

```ini
# Automatically balance extra padding
window-padding-balance = true
```

When viewport dimensions aren't perfectly divisible by cell size, extra padding exists. This option balances it across all edges instead of leaving it on the right and bottom.

### Padding Color

```ini
window-padding-color = background      # Use background color (default)
window-padding-color = extend          # Extend nearest cell color
window-padding-color = extend-always   # Always extend (ignore heuristics)
```

<Accordion title="When does 'extend' disable?">
On primary screen applications (not alternate screen like Vim), vertical extension is disabled if:
- Nearest row has default background color cells
- Nearest row is a prompt (requires shell integration)
- Nearest row contains powerline characters

These heuristics prevent ugly powerline artifacts.
</Accordion>

## Window Behavior

### VSync (macOS)

```ini
# Sync rendering with screen refresh
window-vsync = true   # Minimize tearing (default)
window-vsync = false  # Maximize responsiveness
```

<Warning>
**macOS**: Out-of-sync rendering can cause kernel panics (macOS 14.4+) and performance issues with external displays over DisplayLink.

Set to `false` only if you need minimal input latency and understand the risks.
</Warning>

<Note>
Changing `window-vsync` at runtime only affects new terminals.
</Note>

### Step Resize (macOS)

```ini
# Resize window in cell-size increments
window-step-resize = true
```

When enabled, window resizing snaps to grid cell sizes. When disabled, resizes in pixel increments.

### Working Directory Inheritance

```ini
# New windows inherit working directory
window-inherit-working-directory = true  # Default

# New tabs inherit working directory
tab-inherit-working-directory = true     # Default

# New splits inherit working directory
split-inherit-working-directory = true   # Default
```

<Info>
Inheritance requires **shell integration**. Without it, the default `working-directory` is used.
</Info>

### Font Size Inheritance

```ini
# New windows inherit font size from focused window
window-inherit-font-size = true  # Default
```

When `false`, new windows use the configured `font-size`.

## Window Title

### Fixed Title

```ini
# Force a specific window title
title = My Terminal

# Blank title (effectively hides it)
title = " "
```

<Note>
When set, Ghostty ignores all title change escape sequences from programs.
</Note>

<Accordion title="How do I get the default title back after changing it?">
Reload config with `title` unset or removed. The next title change escape sequence will be honored, but you may need to restart programs (like Neovim) to trigger it.
</Accordion>

### Window Subtitle (GTK)

```ini
window-subtitle = false                # No subtitle (default)
window-subtitle = working-directory    # Show working directory
```

<Note>
**GTK only** (since 1.1.0)
</Note>

### Title Font (macOS)

```ini
# Set custom titlebar font
window-title-font-family = SF Pro Display
```

If unset, the system default font is used. Any font available on the system may be used (not limited to monospace).

## Tabs

### Tab Visibility (GTK)

```ini
window-show-tab-bar = auto     # Show when 2+ tabs (default)
window-show-tab-bar = always   # Always show
window-show-tab-bar = never    # Never show (use keybinds/overview)
```

<Note>
Currently only supported on Linux (GTK).
</Note>

### Tab Position

```ini
window-new-tab-position = current  # After focused tab (default)
window-new-tab-position = end      # At end of tab list
```

## Splits

### Split Appearance

```ini
# Unfocused split opacity (0.15-1.0)
unfocused-split-opacity = 0.7

# Unfocused split dim color
unfocused-split-fill = #000000

# Split divider color (since 1.1.0)
split-divider-color = #3E4451
```

### Preserve Zoom

Control zoom behavior when navigating splits:

```ini
split-preserve-zoom = navigation  # Keep zoom when switching splits
split-preserve-zoom = no-navigation  # Unzoom when switching (default)
```

<Info>
By default, any operation changing focus or layout unzooms. With `navigation`, the zoomed state moves to the newly focused split.

Available since 1.3.0.
</Info>

## Resize Overlay

### When to Show

```ini
resize-overlay = always       # Always show
resize-overlay = never        # Never show
resize-overlay = after-first  # Not on first creation (default)
```

### Overlay Position

```ini
resize-overlay-position = center        # Default
resize-overlay-position = top-left
resize-overlay-position = top-center
resize-overlay-position = top-right
resize-overlay-position = bottom-left
resize-overlay-position = bottom-center
resize-overlay-position = bottom-right
```

### Overlay Duration

```ini
# How long to show overlay (default: 750ms)
resize-overlay-duration = 1s
resize-overlay-duration = 500ms
resize-overlay-duration = 1s500ms
```

## Window State

### Save and Restore (macOS)

```ini
window-save-state = default  # System behavior (default)
window-save-state = always   # Always save on exit
window-save-state = never    # Never save
```

<Accordion title="What does 'default' do?">
On macOS:
- Saves state if app is **forcibly terminated**
- Saves state if configured systemwide in Settings.app

On Linux: No effect (not implemented).
</Accordion>

<Warning>
Changing to `never` while Ghostty isn't running prevents restoring state on next launch. Changing from `never` while not running won't restore previous state (state only saved on exit).
</Warning>

## Window Theme

```ini
window-theme = auto     # Based on terminal background (default)
window-theme = system   # Follow system theme
window-theme = light    # Always light
window-theme = dark     # Always dark
window-theme = ghostty  # Use Ghostty colors (Linux only)
```

<Note>
On macOS with `macos-titlebar-style = tabs` or `transparent`, window theme is automatically determined by background luminosity.
</Note>

### Titlebar Colors (GTK)

```ini
# Only works with window-theme = ghostty
window-titlebar-background = #282C34
window-titlebar-foreground = #FFFFFF
```

## Linux/GTK-Specific

### Application Class

```ini
# X11 WM_CLASS, Wayland app ID, DBus name
class = com.mitchellh.ghostty  # Default
```

<Warning>
Changing `class` creates separate Ghostty instances with `gtk-single-instance=true`. May break `.desktop` file launching and DBus activation.

Must follow [GTK ID requirements](https://docs.gtk.org/gio/type_func.Application.id_is_valid.html).
</Warning>

### X11 Instance Name

```ini
# X11 WM_CLASS instance name
x11-instance-name = ghostty  # Default
```

<Note>
Only affects X11. No effect on Wayland.
</Note>

## macOS-Specific

### Titlebar Style

```ini
macos-titlebar-style = transparent  # Transparent titlebar (default)
macos-titlebar-style = native       # Native macOS titlebar
macos-titlebar-style = tabs         # Custom integrated tab bar
macos-titlebar-style = hidden       # Hidden titlebar, keeps borders
```

<Accordion title="What are the differences between titlebar styles?">
- **native**: Standard macOS titlebar matching window theme
- **transparent**: Native but transparent, shows background color
- **tabs**: Custom titlebar integrating tab bar, matches terminal background
- **hidden**: Removes titlebar but keeps rounded corners and borders
</Accordion>

<Warning>
**tabs** style on macOS 13 and below: Saved window state won't restore tabs correctly. macOS 14+ works fine.
</Warning>

<Info>
**hidden** style: Window can't be dragged by titlebar. Use `option+click` on resizable frame areas to drag (standard macOS behavior).
</Info>

### Window Buttons (macOS)

```ini
macos-window-buttons = visible  # Show traffic lights (default)
macos-window-buttons = hidden   # Hide traffic lights
```

<Note>
No effect when `window-decoration = none` or `macos-titlebar-style = hidden` (buttons always hidden).

Changing at runtime only affects new windows. Since 1.2.0.
</Note>

### Proxy Icon (macOS)

```ini
macos-titlebar-proxy-icon = visible  # Show folder icon (default)
macos-titlebar-proxy-icon = hidden   # Hide folder icon
```

The proxy icon represents the current working directory. Only visible with native titlebar style.

<Info>
Changes at runtime apply to all windows, but only take effect after their working directory changes again (e.g., `cd` to another directory).
</Info>

### Window Shadow (macOS)

```ini
macos-window-shadow = true   # Show shadow (default)
macos-window-shadow = false  # No shadow
```

<Tip>
With window managers and transparency, `false` may look better.
</Tip>

### Non-Native Fullscreen (macOS)

```ini
macos-non-native-fullscreen = false          # Native fullscreen (default)
macos-non-native-fullscreen = true           # Fast fullscreen, hide menu
macos-non-native-fullscreen = visible-menu   # Fast fullscreen, show menu
macos-non-native-fullscreen = padded-notch   # Fast fullscreen, pad notch
```

<Warning>
**Important**: Tabs **do not work** in non-native fullscreen mode (titlebar is removed, macOS tabs require it).

If you fullscreen a tabbed window, the focused tab goes fullscreen while others remain in a background window.
</Warning>

<Accordion title="What's the difference between native and non-native?">
- **Native**: Uses macOS spaces with animations (slower)
- **Non-native**: Instant fullscreen without animations (faster)

`padded-notch` prevents window from being obscured by the notch on applicable devices.
</Accordion>

## Initial Window

```ini
# Create initial window on startup
initial-window = true   # Default
initial-window = false  # Don't create window
```

<Warning>
If `quit-after-last-window-closed = true` and `initial-window = false`, Ghostty quits after the delay if no window is ever created.
</Warning>
