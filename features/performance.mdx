## Rendering Architecture

### Multi-Renderer Design

Ghostty uses different rendering backends optimized for each platform:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="macOS: Metal">
    **Metal renderer** provides native GPU acceleration:
    
    - Direct Metal API usage (no OpenGL compatibility layer)
    - Full ligature support at 60fps+
    - CoreText font integration
    - Maintains ~60fps under heavy load
    
    <Note>
      Ghostty is one of only two terminal emulators using Metal directly, and the only one supporting ligatures with Metal rendering.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Linux: OpenGL">
    **OpenGL renderer** for broad compatibility:
    
    - Modern OpenGL for GPU acceleration
    - FreeType font rendering
    - Ligature support
    - 60fps+ frame rates
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Frame Rate Management

Ghostty intelligently manages frame rates:

- **Heavy load**: Maintains ~60fps
- **Idle**: Renders only on change (power efficient)
- **Animation**: Smooth cursor blink and visual effects

## IO Performance

### Dedicated IO Thread

Ghostty uses a separate thread for IO operations:

```
Main Thread          IO Thread
    |                    |
    |  ← Terminal data ← |
    ↓                    ↓
 Render            Read from PTY
```

Benefits:
- Very little jitter under heavy IO load
- Non-blocking rendering
- Smooth experience with `cat large-file.txt`

### Benchmark Results

From the README:

> For IO, we have a dedicated IO thread that maintains very little jitter under heavy IO load (i.e. `cat <big file>.txt`). On benchmarks for IO, we're usually within a small margin of other fast terminal emulators.

**Comparative performance** (reading plain text dumps):
- **4x faster** than iTerm
- **4x faster** than Kitty  
- **2x faster** than Terminal.app
- **Similar speed** to Alacritty (give or take)

<Note>
  Ghostty provides similar performance to Alacritty while offering significantly more features.
</Note>

## Optimization Tips

### Font Rendering

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose monospace fonts">
    Monospace fonts render faster than proportional fonts:
    
    ```ini
    font-family = "JetBrains Mono"
    font-size = 13
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Disable unnecessary features">
    Disable ligatures if you don't need them:
    
    ```ini
    font-feature = -calt,-liga,-dlig
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Adjust font metrics conservatively">
    Excessive adjustments can impact rendering:
    
    ```ini
    # Minimal adjustments for performance
    adjust-cell-height = 0
    adjust-cell-width = 0
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Background and Effects

<CodeGroup>
```ini Maximum Performance
# Disable transparency
background-opacity = 1.0

# No background image
# background-image = (not set)

# No blur
# background-blur = (not set)
```

```ini Balanced
# Slight transparency
background-opacity = 0.95

# No expensive effects
background-blur = false
```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
  Background images are duplicated in VRAM per-terminal, which can increase memory usage for large images.
</Warning>

### Alpha Blending

Choose the right alpha blending mode:

```ini
# Native color space (macOS default)
alpha-blending = native

# Linear gamma correction (Linux default, good balance)
alpha-blending = linear-corrected

# Pure linear blending
alpha-blending = linear
```

`linear-corrected` provides the best balance of accuracy and performance.

## Resource Usage

### Memory Management

Ghostty is efficient with memory:

- **Scrollback limit**: Configure to match your needs
  ```ini
  scrollback-limit = 10000  # Default
  ```

- **Image storage**: Limit memory for image protocols
  ```ini
  image-storage-limit = 320000000  # 320MB default
  ```

### GPU Memory (VRAM)

Factors affecting VRAM usage:

1. **Font atlas**: Cached glyphs (automatically managed)
2. **Background images**: Duplicated per-terminal (see warning above)
3. **Image protocol**: Controlled by `image-storage-limit`

## Benchmarking

### Test IO Performance

```bash
# Generate a large text file
seq 1 100000 > numbers.txt

# Time rendering
time cat numbers.txt
```

### Test Rendering Performance

```bash
# Stress test with continuous output
yes | head -n 1000000

# Watch CPU usage
top -pid $(pgrep ghostty)
```

### Scrollback Performance

```bash
# Fill scrollback buffer
seq 1 100000

# Test scrollback speed
# Use Page Up/Down or scrollbar
```

## Performance Comparison

| Feature | Ghostty | Alacritty | Kitty | iTerm2 | Terminal.app |
|---------|---------|-----------|-------|--------|-------------|
| GPU Acceleration | ✅ Metal/OpenGL | ✅ OpenGL | ✅ OpenGL | ✅ Metal (no ligatures) | ❌ CPU |
| Ligatures (macOS) | ✅ 60fps | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ (CPU fallback) | ✅ |
| IO Thread | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Large File Speed | Very Fast | Very Fast | Fast | Slow | Medium |
| Memory Usage | Low | Very Low | Medium | High | Low |

## Future Improvements

From the README:

> Despite being _very fast_, there is a lot of room for improvement here.

Planned optimizations:
- Better benchmarking suite
- Additional rendering optimizations  
- Shared texture memory for background images
- Per-window background images

## Configuration Examples

<CodeGroup>
```ini Maximum Performance
# Optimized for speed
font-family = "JetBrains Mono"
font-size = 12
font-feature = -calt,-liga  # Disable ligatures

background-opacity = 1.0
alpha-blending = native

scrollback-limit = 5000
image-storage-limit = 100000000
```

```ini Balanced
# Good performance with features
font-family = "Fira Code"
font-size = 13
# Ligatures enabled (default)

background-opacity = 0.95
alpha-blending = linear-corrected

scrollback-limit = 10000
image-storage-limit = 320000000
```

```ini Feature-Rich
# All features, still fast
font-family = "Cascadia Code"
font-size = 14
font-feature = +ss01,+ss02  # Stylistic sets

background-opacity = 0.9
background-image = ~/.config/ghostty/bg.png
background-image-opacity = 0.3

alpha-blending = linear-corrected
```
</CodeGroup>

## Monitoring Performance

### macOS Activity Monitor

1. Open Activity Monitor
2. Find "Ghostty" process
3. Monitor:
   - **CPU%**: Should be low when idle
   - **Memory**: Depends on scrollback and images
   - **GPU**: Check "Window Server" for GPU usage

### Linux Tools

```bash
# CPU and memory
top -p $(pgrep ghostty)

# Detailed stats
htop -p $(pgrep ghostty)

# GPU usage (NVIDIA)
nvidia-smi

# GPU usage (Intel/AMD)
intel_gpu_top
# or
radeontop
```
