description: Clipboard integration, OSC 52 support, and copy/paste configuration
---

Ghostty provides comprehensive clipboard support with configurable behavior for both system clipboard and terminal-initiated clipboard operations.

## Basic Clipboard Operations

### Copy and Paste

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Copy" icon="copy">
    Select text and it's automatically copied (Linux/macOS default).
    
    Or use:
    - **macOS**: `cmd+c`
    - **Linux**: `ctrl+shift+c`
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Paste" icon="paste">
    - **macOS**: `cmd+v`
    - **Linux**: `ctrl+shift+v`
    - **Middle-click**: Paste selection (Linux)
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Copy on Select

Automatically copy selected text to clipboard:

```ini ~/.config/ghostty/config
# Enable copy-on-select (default on Linux/macOS)
copy-on-select = true

# Disable copy-on-select
copy-on-select = false

# Always copy to both selection and system clipboard
copy-on-select = clipboard
```

<Note>
  On Linux, middle-click paste uses the selection clipboard and works even when `copy-on-select` is `false`.
</Note>

### Right-Click Actions

Configure what right-click does:

```ini
# Show context menu (default)
right-click-action = context-menu

# Paste clipboard contents
right-click-action = paste

# Copy selection
right-click-action = copy

# Copy if text is selected, otherwise paste
right-click-action = copy-or-paste

# Do nothing
right-click-action = ignore
```

## OSC 52 Support

OSC 52 allows terminal applications to read from and write to the system clipboard. This is particularly useful for clipboard operations over SSH.

### Configuration

<CodeGroup>
```ini Ask Before Reading
# Prompt user before allowing clipboard reads (default)
clipboard-read = ask
```

```ini Allow All Operations  
# Allow apps to read/write freely
clipboard-read = allow
clipboard-write = allow
```

```ini Deny All Operations
# Block clipboard access
clipboard-read = deny
clipboard-write = deny
```
</CodeGroup>

Valid values:
- `ask` - Prompt the user (default for clipboard-read)
- `allow` - Allow unconditionally (default for clipboard-write)
- `deny` - Deny all access

### Testing OSC 52

Test clipboard write support:

```bash
# Copy "Hello" to clipboard
printf '\e]52;c;%s\a' "$(printf 'Hello' | base64)"
```

Test clipboard read (if `clipboard-read = allow`):

```bash
# Request clipboard contents
printf '\e]52;c;?\a'
```

<Warning>
  Allowing clipboard read (`clipboard-read = allow`) can be a security risk. Applications can silently read your clipboard contents.
</Warning>

## Clipboard Behavior

### Trimming Whitespace

Remove trailing whitespace when copying:

```ini
# Trim trailing spaces (default: true)
clipboard-trim-trailing-spaces = true

# Preserve all whitespace
clipboard-trim-trailing-spaces = false
```

<Note>
  Completely blank lines always have their whitespace trimmed.
</Note>

### Clearing Selection

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="After Copying">
    Clear selection after copying:
    
    ```ini
    # Keep selection visible after copying (default)
    selection-clear-on-copy = false
    
    # Clear selection after copying
    selection-clear-on-copy = true
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="When Typing">
    Clear selection when typing:
    
    ```ini
    # Clear selection when typing (default)
    selection-clear-on-typing = true
    
    # Keep selection when typing
    selection-clear-on-typing = false
    ```
    
    Selection can still be cleared manually by clicking or pressing `escape`.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Paste Protection

Prevent accidental execution of dangerous commands:

```ini
# Warn before pasting text with newlines (default: true)
clipboard-paste-protection = true

# Treat bracketed pastes as safe (default: true)  
clipboard-paste-bracketed-safe = true
```

<Steps>
  <Step title="Protection activates">
    When pasting text containing newlines, Ghostty shows a confirmation dialog.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Bracketed paste exception">
    If the application has bracketed paste mode enabled, the paste is considered safe and no confirmation is shown (unless `clipboard-paste-bracketed-safe = false`).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Advanced Features

### Clipboard Character Mapping

Replace specific Unicode characters when copying to clipboard:

```ini
# Convert box-drawing characters to ASCII
clipboard-codepoint-map = U+2500=U+002D  # Horizontal → hyphen
clipboard-codepoint-map = U+2502=U+007C  # Vertical → pipe

# Replace with text
clipboard-codepoint-map = U+03A3=SUM     # Greek Sigma → "SUM"

# Ranges
clipboard-codepoint-map = U+2500-U+257F=U+002D  # All box-drawing
```

<Note>
  This only applies to text copying, not URL copying.
</Note>

### Selection Word Characters

Define what characters mark word boundaries during selection:

```ini
# Default word boundaries
selection-word-chars = " \t'\"│`|:;,()[]{}<>$"

# Treat dashes as part of words
selection-word-chars = " \t'\"│`|:;,()[]{}<>$"
```

When double-clicking to select a word, selection stops at these characters.

## Keybinding Examples

<CodeGroup>
```ini Custom Copy/Paste
keybind = ctrl+c=copy_to_clipboard
keybind = ctrl+v=paste_from_clipboard
keybind = ctrl+shift+v=paste_from_selection
```

```ini Clipboard Management
keybind = ctrl+shift+c=copy_to_clipboard
keybind = ctrl+shift+v=paste_from_clipboard

# Clear selection
keybind = escape=clear_selection
```

```ini Advanced Workflow
# Copy and clear selection
keybind = ctrl+c=copy_to_clipboard>clear_selection

# Paste and clear
keybind = ctrl+v=paste_from_clipboard>clear_selection
```
</CodeGroup>

## Platform Differences

### macOS

- Uses the system pasteboard
- Supports rich text copying (with formatting)
- Integrates with Universal Clipboard (copy on Mac, paste on iPhone)

### Linux

- Two clipboards: **selection** (middle-click) and **system** (ctrl+v)
- Selection clipboard is automatically populated when selecting text
- System clipboard requires explicit copy action

```ini
# Configure copy-on-select behavior for Linux
copy-on-select = true          # Use selection clipboard
copy-on-select = clipboard     # Use both clipboards
copy-on-select = false         # Explicit copy only
```

## SSH and Remote Clipboard

When connected to a remote host via SSH, OSC 52 allows remote applications to access your local clipboard:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable OSC 52 write">
    ```ini
    clipboard-write = allow
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure remote app">
    Many applications support OSC 52:
    
    - **tmux**: `set -s set-clipboard on`
    - **vim**: Use plugins like [vim-oscyank](https://github.com/ojroques/vim-oscyank)
    - **neovim**: Built-in OSC 52 support
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Copy remotely">
    When you copy text in the remote application, it appears in your local clipboard.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Example: Neovim Over SSH

```lua
-- Neovim config for OSC 52 clipboard
vim.g.clipboard = {
  name = 'OSC 52',
  copy = {
    ['+'] = require('vim.ui.clipboard.osc52').copy('+'),
    ['*'] = require('vim.ui.clipboard.osc52').copy('*'),
  },
  paste = {
    ['+'] = require('vim.ui.clipboard.osc52').paste('+'),
    ['*'] = require('vim.ui.clipboard.osc52').paste('*'),
  },
}
```

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Clipboard not working over SSH">
    1. Verify OSC 52 is enabled: `clipboard-write = allow`
    2. Ensure remote application supports OSC 52
    3. Check SSH doesn't strip escape sequences
    4. Test with the OSC 52 printf command shown above
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Selection not copying automatically">
    Check `copy-on-select` is enabled:
    
    ```ini
    copy-on-select = true
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Middle-click paste not working (Linux)">
    Middle-click paste is always enabled and uses the selection clipboard. Make sure you've selected text first, or check if another application has cleared the selection.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Paste confirmation dialog appearing too often">
    If bracketed paste mode is available but still showing confirmation:
    
    ```ini
    clipboard-paste-bracketed-safe = true
    ```
    
    Or disable paste protection entirely (not recommended):
    
    ```ini
    clipboard-paste-protection = false
    ```
  </Accordion>
