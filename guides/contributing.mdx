description: Learn how to contribute to Ghostty through bug reports, features, translations, and code contributions
---

This guide covers the process for contributing to Ghostty. Whether you want to report a bug, request a feature, or submit code, please read this document carefully.

<Note>
Ghostty is a personal project maintained in free time by its contributors. Please take a few minutes to read this guide to ensure your contributions can be reviewed and accepted efficiently. Thank you!
</Note>

## The Critical Rule

<Warning>
**You must understand your code.** If you can't explain what your changes do and how they interact with the greater system without the aid of AI tools, do not contribute to this project.
</Warning>

Using AI to write code is acceptable, but you must:
- Fully understand all code you submit
- Be able to explain design decisions
- Answer questions about your implementation
- Have interrogated the AI to grasp all edge cases and effects

See the full [AI Usage Policy](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/blob/main/AI_POLICY.md) for details.

## First-Time Contributors: Vouch System

Ghostty uses a vouch system for first-time contributors to maintain code quality:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open a Vouch Request">
    Open a [discussion in the "Vouch Request" category](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/discussions/new?category=vouch-request) following the template.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Describe your contribution">
    Keep it concise. Explain:
    - What you want to change
    - Why it's valuable
    - Your approach (if applicable)

    **Write in your own voice** - don't have AI write this.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for approval">
    A maintainer will comment `!vouch` if approved. Once vouched, you can submit pull requests.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
**Unvouched contributors**: Any pull requests you open will be automatically closed. This system exists because AI has made it trivial to generate plausible-looking but low-quality contributions.
</Warning>

## Denouncement System

If you repeatedly break the rules or submit low-quality work, you will be **denounced**:

- Your username will be added to a public list of bad actors
- All future interactions will be automatically closed
- Other projects may use this list to block you automatically

<Note>
We love helping junior developers learn and grow! If you want to learn, don't rely on AI - ask for help and guidance instead. The denouncement system is for bad actors, not learners.
</Note>

## Quick Guide for Contributors

### I'd like to contribute code

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find an actionable issue">
    Browse the [issue tracker](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues). **All issues are actionable** - every issue is ready to be worked on.

    Look for issues tagged ["contributor friendly"](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22contributor+friendly%22) if you're new.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Comment on the issue">
    Let others know you're working on it. Ask questions if you need guidance.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Read the development guide">
    See [HACKING.md](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/blob/main/HACKING.md) for technical details on building and testing.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Submit a pull request">
    Follow the [Pull Request Guidelines](#pull-request-guidelines) below.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### I'd like to translate Ghostty

Translations are welcome! See the [Translator's Guide](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/blob/main/po/README_TRANSLATORS.md).

Translations usually don't need issue triage and can be submitted directly as pull requests. Make sure to follow the [Style Guide](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/blob/main/po/README_TRANSLATORS.md#style-guide).

### I have a bug to report

<Steps>
  <Step title="Search existing issues">
    Search both [open](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues) and [closed](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues?q=is%3Aissue+state%3Aclosed) issues and [discussions](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/discussions) - your bug might already be fixed!
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open an Issue Triage discussion">
    If not found, open an ["Issue Triage" discussion](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/discussions/new?category=issue-triage) and **fill in the template completely**.

    <Warning>
    Do NOT file bug reports as Q&A or Feature Requests. Use "Issue Triage" for bugs - it collects vital system information.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for triage">
    Maintainers will investigate and move it to the issue tracker if actionable.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
If there's an existing open issue that matches your problem, **don't comment unless you have valuable insight**. Use the upvote button or emoji reactions instead to avoid spamming all participants.
</Note>

### I have a feature request

<Steps>
  <Step title="Search existing discussions and issues">
    Your feature may have already been requested or implemented.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open a Feature Request discussion">
    If not found, open a discussion in the ["Feature Requests, Ideas" category](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/discussions/new?category=feature-requests-ideas).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for feedback">
    Maintainers will discuss the feature. If accepted and well-scoped, it will be moved to the issue tracker.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### I have a question

For general questions:

- Open a [Q&A discussion](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/discussions/new?category=q-a)
- Join the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/ghostty) and ask in the `#help` forum channel

<Note>
If your question is about a missing feature, use "Feature Requests". If Ghostty is behaving unexpectedly, use "Issue Triage".
</Note>

## Important Patterns

### Issues are Actionable

The Ghostty [issue tracker](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues) is for **actionable items only**.

- **Discussions** are for bug reports, feature requests, and questions
- **Issues** are for well-understood, actionable work
- Once a discussion reaches a clear action item, it's moved to the issue tracker
- This makes it easy to find work that's ready to start

### Pull Requests Implement an Issue

Pull requests should be associated with a previously accepted issue.

<Warning>
If you open a pull request for something that wasn't previously discussed, it may be closed or remain stale indefinitely.
</Warning>

Issues tagged with "feature" represent accepted, well-scoped feature requests. If you implement an issue as described, your PR will likely be accepted.

<Note>
**Pull requests are NOT a place to discuss feature design.** Use discussions and link to your branch instead.
</Note>

## AI Usage Policy

Ghostty has strict rules for AI usage. Please read the full [AI Usage Policy](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/blob/main/AI_POLICY.md).

<Warning>
**All AI usage must be disclosed.** State:
- The tool you used (e.g., Claude Code, Cursor, Amp, GitHub Copilot)
- The extent of AI assistance
- What you understand vs what was AI-generated
</Warning>

**Key rules:**

- You must fully understand all code you submit
- No AI-generated media (art, images, videos, audio)
- Issues and discussions can use AI but must be human-reviewed and edited
- Bad AI drivers will be denounced

**The project welcomes AI as a tool**, but holds high standards for contributors who use it. Most AI usage issues stem from unqualified people using AI, not from AI itself.

### AI Assistance for Development

If you're using AI to help develop Ghostty:

- Ghostty provides an [AGENTS.md file](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/blob/main/AGENTS.md) for AI agents
- Commands in `.agents/commands` have vetted prompts for common tasks
- Example: `/gh-issue <number/url>` for diagnosing GitHub issues (requires `gh` CLI)

## Pull Request Guidelines

<Steps>
  <Step title="Link to the issue">
    Reference the issue your PR implements:
    ```
    Fixes #1234
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Write clear commit messages">
    Focus on the "why" rather than the "what":
    ```
    Add support for custom keybindings

    Implements #1234. Users can now define custom keybindings
    in their config file using the keybind option.
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test your changes">
    Run tests before submitting:
    ```bash
    zig build test
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Format your code">
    ```bash
    # Zig code
    zig fmt .

    # Other files
    prettier --write .
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Disclose AI usage (if applicable)">
    In your PR description, disclose any AI assistance:
    ```
    AI Disclosure: Used GitHub Copilot for boilerplate code.
    All logic was written and verified by me.
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Development Workflow

For technical details on building, testing, and developing Ghostty:

**Read [HACKING.md](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/blob/main/HACKING.md)** - includes:
- Building from source
- Development dependencies
- Running tests
- Memory leak checking
- Logging and debugging
- Platform-specific requirements

**Key commands:**

```bash
# Build debug version
zig build

# Run Ghostty
zig build run

# Run tests
zig build test

# Run specific tests
zig build test -Dtest-filter=terminal

# Check for memory leaks (Linux)
zig build run-valgrind

# Format code
zig fmt .
prettier --write .
```

## Code Standards

### Zig Code

- Follow Zig style guidelines
- Run `zig fmt .` before committing
- Write tests for new functionality
- Document public APIs

### Documentation and Resources

- Format with Prettier: `prettier --write .`
- Match the Prettier version in `nix/devShell.nix`
- Use clear, concise language

### Commit Messages

- Summarize the change (add, update, fix, refactor, etc.)
- Focus on "why" not "what"
- Reference issue numbers
- Keep first line under 72 characters

**Example:**
```
Add support for custom color schemes

Fixes #1234. Users can now define custom color schemes in separate
files and reference them from the main config. This makes it easier
to switch between themes.
```
