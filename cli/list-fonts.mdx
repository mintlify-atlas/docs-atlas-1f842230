description: List all available fonts using Ghostty's font discovery mechanism
---

The `list-fonts` command displays all fonts available to Ghostty using the same font discovery mechanism that Ghostty uses to find fonts for rendering.

## Usage

```bash
ghostty +list-fonts [options]
```

## Description

When executed with no arguments, this command lists all available fonts, sorted by family name, then font name. The output is grouped by font family for easier reading.

If a family name is specified with `--family`, the sorting is disabled and results are shown in the same priority order Ghostty would use to pick a font. This is useful for debugging why your desired font may not be loading.

## Options

<ParamField path="--family" type="string">
  Filter results to a specific font family. The family handling is identical to the `font-family` configuration value, so this can be used to debug font loading issues.
  
  When specified, results are shown in the priority order Ghostty uses for font selection rather than alphabetically.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="--style" type="string">
  Filter results based on the style string advertised by a font. Results matching this style are prioritized, but it's not guaranteed that only matching styles are returned.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="--bold" type="boolean">
  Filter results to bold styles. Matching styles are prioritized, but it's not guaranteed that only bold styles are returned.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="--italic" type="boolean">
  Filter results to italic styles. Matching styles are prioritized, but it's not guaranteed that only italic styles are returned.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="-h, --help" type="flag">
  Display help information for this command.
</ParamField>

## Examples

### List All Available Fonts

```bash
ghostty +list-fonts
```

<CodeGroup>
```text Output
Cascadia Code
  Cascadia Code Bold
  Cascadia Code Bold Italic
  Cascadia Code Italic
  Cascadia Code Regular

Fira Code
  Fira Code Bold
  Fira Code Light
  Fira Code Medium
  Fira Code Regular

JetBrains Mono
  JetBrains Mono Bold
  JetBrains Mono Bold Italic
  JetBrains Mono Italic
  JetBrains Mono Regular
```
</CodeGroup>

### Check Font Loading Priority

```bash
ghostty +list-fonts --family="JetBrains Mono"
```

<CodeGroup>
```text Output
JetBrains Mono
  JetBrains Mono Regular
  JetBrains Mono Bold
  JetBrains Mono Italic
  JetBrains Mono Bold Italic
```
</CodeGroup>

This shows the exact order Ghostty would consider fonts from the JetBrains Mono family.

### Filter by Bold Style

```bash
ghostty +list-fonts --bold
```

Displays all fonts, prioritizing bold variants.

### Debug Font Configuration

```bash
ghostty +list-fonts --family="Monaco" --bold
```

Use this to verify if Ghostty can find a bold variant of Monaco, and in what priority order.

## Notes

<Note>
  If Ghostty was built without font discovery support, this command will display an error message indicating that font discovery is not available.
</Note>

<Note>
  The `--family` option uses the same matching logic as the `font-family` configuration option, making it perfect for debugging font loading issues in your config.
